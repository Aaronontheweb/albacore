title: "v0.2.3 Release Notes: Nuget Tasks And More!"
---

Albacore v0.2.3 has been pushed up to RubyGems.org. It contains a handful of new tasks, including support for building and packaging Nuget packages! 

Rather than take the time to spell out all of the details of each task in one long blog post, though, I'm only going to give a list of the things that have been done in this release. For details on the new and modified tasks, please check out the ["albacore wiki":http://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore/wiki]. The wiki pages are still in progress for some of the tasks and changes. Please check back often and contribute your own changes to them.
